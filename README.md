# GetThatCode

GetThatCode is a lightweight web app built for instant code sharing.

Back in school, I often needed a quick way to share code with friends without repeatedly sending files or messages. This app started as a simple solution — upload code once and let anyone access and copy it instantly through a browser.

It’s a minimal, practical project that reflects one of my early attempts at solving a real life problem with code.
